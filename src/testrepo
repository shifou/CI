Test one Action at a time

	Test case 1: From alice to bob 
	test function: Action:”delay” using send rule 2

	input:
			send#bob#process#Lookup#alice to bob
			send#bob#process#Ack#alice to bob
			send#bob#process#Lookup#alice to bob
			send#bob#process#Ack#alice to bob

	Problem: 
			Kinda pass the test case, but it will create a new socket after every delay (according to the output on the console)


	
	Test case 2: From charlie to bob

	test function: Action:”duplicate” using send rule 3 and recv rule 1

	input:
			send#bob#process#Ack#alice to bob
			send#bob#process#Ack#alice to bob

	Passed


	Test case 3: From bob to alice

	test function: Action:”drop”, using send rule 1

	input:
			send#alice#process#Ack#bob to alice
			send#alice#process#Ack#bob to alice
			send#alice#process#Ack#bob to alice
			send#alice#process#Ack#bob to alice(which is supposed to be dropped)
			send#alice#process#Ack#bob to alice

	Passed



	Test case 4: From bob to alice

	test function: Action:"delay in recv side", using recv rule 2

	input:
			{charlie}	send#alice#process#Ack#bob to alice		(be delayed on recv side)
			{bob}		send#alice#process#Ack#bob to alice		(triger to process the delayed message)


	Passed


	
	configFileParse.java can pass all test cases and return the right actions.



Mixed test:


	Test case 1: From bob to alice

	test function: Action:”duplicate + drop”, using send rule 3 to duplicate and recv rule 1 to drop

	input:
			send#alice#process#Lookup#bob to alice		(which is supposed to be duplicated and then be dropped)
			send#alice#process#Ack#bob to alice 		(won't be duplicated and dropped)
	
	passed


	Test case 2: From charlie to bob

	test function: Action:”duplicate + delay”, using send rule 3 to duplicate and recv rule 3 to delay

	input:
			send#bob#process#Ack#charlie to bob			(which is supposed to be duplicated and then be 											delayed)
   {alice}  send#bob#process#Ack#alice to bob			(which is supposed to be dropped when receive and 													and causes the process of delayed 			     													message)



   	passed


	Test case 3: From alice to charlie

	test function: Action:”delay + drop”, using send rule to delay and recv rule to drop

	input:
			send#charlie#process#Ack#alice to charlie 	(supposed to be delayed and then be dropped)
			send#charlie#process#Lookup#alice to charlie	(supposed to be delayed but will not be dropped)
			send#charlie#process#Ack#bob to charlie		(is used to triger peer to process the delayed message)

	Failed, a little bit complicated, need to figure out why later.
